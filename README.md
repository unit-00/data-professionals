### Motivation
---
I am interested to learn about this field that works with data and databases. Since I will be working with other data professionals, it'll be good to be well informed.

### Dataset
---
The dataset came from [Brent Ozar's Salary Survey](https://www.brentozar.com/archive/2019/01/the-2019-data-professional-salary-survey-results/). 
- Responses from people around the world, answering questions regarding their job
    - year 2017 to 2019
- The data has 6893 rows by 29 columns
    - A mixture of strings and numbers
- I focused on the US, because 65% of the responses originated from there
- The survey evolved over time, some features do not have data in previous years

I have also collected data from [Capitol Impact's Government Gateway](https://www.ciclt.net/sn/clt/capitolimpact/gw_default.aspx).
- This database has state information on the zipcode of the responses.

**Caveat:**  
The data size is quite small, thus should take the tests and analysis with caution.

### Exploration
---
For this analysis, I focused on the difference of salary between three groups
- Not Looking for a new job
- Passively Looking for a new job
- Actively Looking for a new job

This particular write up will dive deeper into the features that I looked at that might influence the salary.

Features such as
- Primary Database
- Years With The Database
- Employment Status
- Job Titles
- Years With This Type of Job
- Amount of Other People On The Team
- Education
- Hours Worked Per Week
- Employment Sector
- Gender
